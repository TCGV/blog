I recently watched an interesting video titled [How AI & LLMs are Shaping Financial Advice](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ui7kRlJMqjM) by MIT Professor [Andrew W. Lo](https://mitsloan.mit.edu/faculty/directory/andrew-w-lo). In it, he discusses how LLMs could be used for tasks like analyzing financial reports and offering sound financial advice. He also touches on the challenges of oversight, trust and fiduciary duty, sharing his thoughts on how these issues might be addressed in the long run.

Right after that, YouTube suggested a news report from BBC about the Israel conflict in the Middle East, and that gave me an idea for an experiment. You see, we might be on the verge of an escalation in that conflict, and if it happens (I hope it doesn't), I'm sure it'll have a significant impact on the financial markets. I'm also sure that I'm not prepared for it, and that (again, if it happens) I'll think in hindsight that I could have hedged against the real, though uncertain, possibility of escalation.

So in this experiment, I prepared a simple CoT (Chain-of-Thought) prompt to enlighten me about the possibilities ahead and advise me on what I could do. Let's take a look at it below.

The prompt
======

<div class="chat-message" markdown="1">

 If a conflict escalation occurs between Israel and Palestine in the Middle East, potentially involving Lebanon and possibly Iran...

 1) What will happen to the global economy?

  1.1) How might the global economy react if the conflict escalates further (e.g., involving the U.S.)?

 2) Which currencies, commodities, bonds, and investments are likely to strengthen in this scenario, and which ones are likely to weaken?

 3) How can I protect my capital in such a situation?

  3.1) If the situation deescalates, what would be a balanced asset allocation strategy to hedge against both escalation and deescalation scenarios?

</div>


The purpose of this prompt is to first explain the typical impacts of conflict escalation on the global economy. Then, it analyzes the effects on an investor's portfolio. Finally, it seeks advice on how to balance the portfolio, considering both the chances of escalation and de-escalation (essentially as a hedge).

I think with a little more effort, we could've made an even better prompt. But it's friday so let’s give this one a shot and see what we get!

The reply
======

<div class="chat-message" markdown="1">

If the conflict between Israel and Palestine escalates, especially involving countries like Lebanon, Iran, and potentially drawing in global powers like the U.S., the global economy could be affected in several ways. Here’s an overview of what could happen, which investments might be impacted, and how you could protect your capital:

### 1. Global Economic Reaction to Conflict Escalation
If the conflict escalates into a broader regional war, the global economy could react in several ways:
- **Energy Supply Shocks:** The Middle East is a crucial hub for global oil production. Any conflict that disrupts production or threatens the Strait of Hormuz (through which a significant percentage of the world's oil passes) could send oil prices soaring. This would lead to inflationary pressures globally, particularly in energy-dependent economies.
  
- **Market Volatility:** Investors might seek safer investments, leading to increased volatility in equity markets. Emerging markets could be especially vulnerable as they often rely on stable energy prices and foreign investment, both of which would be impacted.
  
- **Risk-Off Sentiment:** Global investors tend to shift to safer, low-risk assets in times of uncertainty or geopolitical turmoil, which can affect multiple asset classes.

### 2. Impact on Currencies, Commodities, Bonds, and Investments

**Strengthening Assets:**
- **Commodities (Oil and Gold):** 
   - **Oil:** Any conflict in the Middle East typically leads to a rise in oil prices due to potential supply disruptions. Energy stocks might see a boost as oil prices rise.
   - **Gold:** Gold is traditionally viewed as a safe-haven asset during geopolitical tensions. Its price tends to rise when uncertainty or war escalates.
  
- **Currencies (USD and CHF):**
   - **USD (U.S. Dollar):** The U.S. dollar tends to strengthen during global crises due to its status as a reserve currency and safe haven. Investors flock to the dollar in times of geopolitical instability.
   - **CHF (Swiss Franc):** Similar to the U.S. dollar, the Swiss franc is considered a stable, safe currency. It often appreciates during global turmoil.

- **Bonds (U.S. Treasuries, German Bunds):**
   - **U.S. Treasuries:** Investors tend to move into U.S. Treasuries during times of global uncertainty. This will likely lead to lower yields (higher prices) for these bonds.
   - **German Bunds:** German bonds, considered some of the safest in Europe, are another place where investors might park capital during geopolitical crises.

**Weakening Assets:**
- **Equities (Especially in Emerging Markets):**
   - Stocks, particularly in riskier or emerging markets, are likely to decline as investor sentiment turns risk-averse. Even developed markets might face downturns as investors sell off riskier assets in favor of bonds or safer investments.

- **Middle Eastern Currencies (Israeli Shekel, Lebanese Pound):**
   - Currencies of countries directly involved in or geographically close to the conflict are likely to weaken. Investors may lose confidence in these currencies due to instability and fear of prolonged conflict.

### 3. Protecting Your Capital During Escalation

- **Increase Allocation to Safe-Haven Assets:** 
   - **Gold and Precious Metals:** Allocate part of your portfolio to gold or other precious metals.
   - **U.S. Treasuries or Investment-Grade Bonds:** Move towards high-quality bonds, such as U.S. Treasuries, or investment-grade corporate bonds to reduce risk and provide stability during market volatility.
   - **Hold More Cash in USD or CHF:** Having more liquidity in safe-haven currencies can provide flexibility and safety as the situation evolves.

- **Energy Sector Exposure:** Increasing exposure to energy stocks or commodities like oil could provide a hedge against rising energy prices during conflict escalation.

- **Diversification:** Ensure that your portfolio is diversified across geographies, sectors, and asset classes to minimize exposure to any one region or sector impacted by the conflict.

### 4. Balanced Asset Allocation Strategy for Escalation and De-escalation Scenarios

If you want to hedge against both escalation and de-escalation scenarios, you can adopt a balanced asset allocation strategy:

**Escalation Hedge:**
- **Commodities Exposure:** Maintain some exposure to commodities like gold and oil. In times of escalation, these would benefit from flight-to-safety dynamics and potential supply disruptions.
  
- **Safe-Haven Bonds:** Allocate to U.S. Treasuries or other low-risk government bonds, as they would strengthen in the event of increased geopolitical risk.

**De-escalation Hedge:**
- **Growth-Oriented Equities:** Once the situation deescalates, global equity markets may recover, particularly in sectors that are cyclically sensitive like technology, consumer discretionary, or industrials. Maintain some exposure to these equities to capture potential upside.
  
- **Emerging Markets Exposure:** If tensions ease, emerging markets that were initially hit hard may rebound strongly, making them an attractive investment for growth in a de-escalated environment.

**Overall Strategy:**
- **60/40 or 50/30/20 Allocation:** A traditional balanced allocation could work:
   - **60% Equities:** Diversify across geographies and sectors (some growth-oriented, some defensive).
   - **40% Bonds:** Split between safe-haven government bonds and investment-grade corporate bonds.
   - **20% Commodities & Alternative Investments:** This portion can include gold, oil, and possibly some real estate or infrastructure investments that are less correlated with traditional assets.

By maintaining a diversified portfolio that includes both risk-on and risk-off assets, you can protect your capital and remain prepared for both escalation and de-escalation of geopolitical tensions.

There was a mix of stuff a bit obvious and some things that were new to me in the reply. But hey, sometimes the obvious needs to be said, right? Overall, I thought the info was pretty impressive. Then again, I’m not a financial analyst, so I might be falling into the [Gell-Mann Amnesia effect](https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/Gell-Mann_Amnesia_effect) without even realizing it.


Closing thoughts
======

It was a fun, quick experiment, and I learned a thing or two about global dynamics. Even though I won't be following this advice for practical reasons, the main goal was to share it openly and get feedback from some friends in the financial sector. I also want to let it sit for a while, maybe check back in a year to see if GPT-4's advice was somewhat valuable or just generic/simplistic fluff.

    <h1>About me</h1>
    <span>Hi there, my name is Thomas Vilhena 😄<br><br>I’m a technical co-founder and CTO at MindMiners. We build web and mobile products that help brands make decisions with reliable consumer data. Over the last decade I’ve grown from hands-on engineering into leading multi-squad product delivery (Web, Mobile, Data), information security, cloud infrastructure, and compliance with Brazil’s data protection law. In 2025, after a CEO transition, my role expanded beyond the CTO scope: I started supporting company-wide execution more directly, partnering with Operations, strengthening management routines, contributing to financial planning, and joining board-level discussions. I care about high-performing teams, strong engineering standards, and pragmatic innovation that turns technology into operational leverage and consistent customer value.<br><br>Feel free to get in touch at thomas [dot] vilhena [at] gmail [dot] com</span>
